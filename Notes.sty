***LLM***
-> Large Language Model
-> It is type of artificial intelligence disgn to understand ,process and  generate human language
-> It is already trained on massive amount of text data such as books and websites
-> LLM lend complex patterns in language to produce meaningful responses, translates language , summarize text, answers questions and resisting 
-> they use deeplearning techniques


Topics
-> prefix sum - range arrays
-> circular arrays

Prefix sum is also known as cummulative sum is a technique used to calculate the sum of elements in an array or list efficiently.
It involves creating a new array where each element at index i represents the sum of all elements from the original array from index 0 to i.
This allows for quick calculation of the sum of any subarray by subtracting the prefix sum at the starting index from the prefix sum at the ending index.

In java there is no concept of garbage values instead the uninitialized variables have default values based on their data types.
Default value for integer catagory(byte,short,int,long) is 0
Default value for floating point catagory(float,double) is 0.0f, 0.0d
Default value for string is null
Default value for char is '\u0000' (null character)
Default value for boolean is false
Default value for object reference is null

Method local variables in java you have to declare and initialise in a single line otherwise it will give a compile time error

Circular array
An array is called circular if we consider the first element as next of the last element. Circular arrays are used to implement queue


KMP ALGORITHM
The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm is an efficient string matching algorithm that
It is very useful when it comes to finding multiple patterns in a text or when the pattern is long and complex.
The navie solution for this problen is to compare the pattern with every possible substring of the text, which can be inefficient for large texts or patterns.Starting from the left most position and moving rightwards this takes O)n*m) time complexity in worst case where n is the length of the text and m is the length of the pattern.
When we work with long text pattern the navie method and broute force method becomes inefficient.
-> KMP Algorithm is an efficient string searching algorithm. It utilizes a pre-computed lps array for the pattern to avoid rescanning the text when a mismatch occurs.

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS WHERE KMP ALGORITHM IS USED
1. Text Editors: KMP algorithm is used in text editors for find and replace functionality.
2. DNA Sequence Analysis: KMP algorithm is used in bioinformatics for searching specific patterns in DNA sequences.
3. Network Security: KMP algorithm is used in network security for pattern matching in intrusion detection

                                   Collection




Collection
    Collection interface is super interface of list ,set and queue and all collection interfaces
    we can add elemets at any position
    allows duplicate elements
    allows multiple null elements
    Allows us to iterate data only in forward direction

List:
    lsit preserves insertion order
    list allows to add elements at any position
    list allows to delete elements at any position
    list allows duplicate elements
    lsit allows multiple null elements
    list is a bi directional iterator
        Meaning iterate forward direction -Iterator/ for eac
        hfor forward/ backward  --- listIterator
Set:
    set does not preserve insertion order
    set does not allow to add elements at any position
    set does not allow to delete elements at any position
    set does not allow duplicate elements
    set allows only one null element
    set is a bi directional iterator
        Meaning iterate forward direction -Iterator/ for each
        hfor forward/ backward  --- listIterator
    HashSet - underlying data structure is hash table
    LinkedHashSet - underlying data structure is linked list and hash table
    TreeSet (Stores the elemnts in sorted Order and if null entry is available then it will throw a runtime error )

CONSISTENT Hashing
CONSUSTENT HASHING IS A technique used in distributed systems to distribute data or requests among a set of servers or in the way that minimizes the impact when servers can be added or removed.
Unlike tradional hashing hash(key) % num_servers where adding or removing a server can neccessitae remapping a large portion of keys consistemt hashing aims to only remap a small fraction of keys.
